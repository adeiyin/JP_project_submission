# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, with a specific visualization for daily new confirmed cases in Nigeria. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook with Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualizations. The data is sourced from time-series CSV files provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends globally, with a focus on Nigeria's daily new cases.
- **Data Sources**: Three CSV files (`time_series_covid19_confirmed_global-2.csv`, `time_series_covid19_deaths_global-2.csv`, `time_series_covid19_recovered_global-2.csv`) containing time-series data from January 22, 2020, to March 9, 2023.
- **Tools**: Python 3.12.7, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, requests, BeautifulSoup.
- **Output**: A scatter plot of daily new confirmed cases for Nigeria.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib requests beautifulsoup4
  ```
- Ensure Python 3.12.7 or a compatible version is installed on your system.
- Use a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab or VS Code with Jupyter support).

### Data Preparation
1. **Locate CSV Files**:
   - Obtain the three CSV files from the JHU dataset (e.g., downloaded to `/Users/user/Downloads/COVID/` as shown in the notebook).
   - Update the file paths in the code if saved elsewhere (e.g., replace `/Users/user/Downloads/COVID/` with your directory).

2. **Verify File Structure**:
   - Each CSV should contain columns such as `Province/State`, `Country/Region`, `Lat`, `Long`, and daily case counts (e.g., `1/22/20` to `3/9/23`).

## Project Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries
- **Task**: Load necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Imported `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
  - Imported `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for potential web data retrieval (not used in the current code).
  - Imported `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - Suppressed FutureWarning messages with `warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)` for cleaner output.
- **Outcome**: Established a foundation for data processing and visualization.

### 2. Loading Datasets
- **Task**: Load the three COVID-19 time-series CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
- **Implementation**:
  - Loaded `confirmed` cases with `pd.read_csv('/Users/user/Downloads/COVID/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global-2.csv')`.
  - Loaded `deaths` with `pd.read_csv('/Users/user/Downloads/COVID/time_series_covid19_deaths_global-2.csv')`.
  - Loaded `recovered` with `pd.read_csv('/Users/user/Downloads/COVID/time_series_covid19_recovered_global-2.csv')`.
  - Note: Paths are specific to the user's local machine; adjust as needed.
- **Outcome**: Three DataFrames (`confirmed`, `deaths`, `recovered`) containing global COVID-19 data from 289 countries/regions over ~1,147 days.

### 3. Data Exploration
- **Task**: Inspect the structure of the `confirmed` cases dataset.
- **Implementation**:
  - Displayed the `confirmed` DataFrame using `confirmed`, showing columns like `Province/State`, `Country/Region`, `Lat`, `Long`, and daily counts from `1/22/20` to `3/9/23`.
  - Observed 289 rows (countries/regions) and 1,147 columns (dates plus metadata).
- **Outcome**: Confirmed data includes geographic coordinates and cumulative case counts, with `NaN` values in `Province/State` for countries without sub-regions.

### 4. Data Processing and Visualization
- **Task**: Calculate and visualize daily new confirmed cases for Nigeria.
- **Implementation**:
  - `nigeria_confirmed` was created by filtering the `confirmed` DataFrame for Nigeria (e.g., `nigeria_confirmed = confirmed[confirmed['Country/Region'] == 'Nigeria'].iloc[:, 4:].sum()` to aggregate daily counts).
  - Calculated daily new cases with `daily_new_cases = nigeria_confirmed.diff().fillna(0)`, where `diff()` computes the difference between consecutive days, and `fillna(0)` handles the first day's `NaN`.
  - Created a scatter plot with:
    - `plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))` for a 12x6 inch figure.
    - `plt.scatter(daily_new_cases.index, daily_new_cases, color='orange', alpha=0.5)` to plot dates vs. new cases.
    - `plt.title('Daily New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases (Nigeria)')`, `plt.xlabel('Date')`, `plt.ylabel('New Cases')` for labeling.
    - `plt.grid(True)` and `plt.tight_layout()` for readability.
    - `plt.show()` to display the plot.
- **Outcome**: A scatter plot showing daily new cases in Nigeria from January 2020 to March 2023, highlighting trends and fluctuations.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Save the `jhu.ipynb` notebook and CSV files in the same directory or update paths accordingly.

2. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
   - Run all cells sequentially:
     - Cell 1: Imports libraries.
     - Cell 2: Loads CSV files (adjust paths if needed).
     - Cell 3: Displays `confirmed` DataFrame.
     - Cell 4: Generates the scatter plot (ensure `nigeria_confirmed` is defined).

3. **View Outputs**:
   - The `confirmed` DataFrame will display in the notebook.
   - The scatter plot will appear as a separate output.

## Results and Insights
- **Data Structure**: The dataset spans over three years, covering 289 countries with cumulative counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Nigeria Trends**: The scatter plot of daily new cases reveals variability, with potential peaks during major waves (e.g., 2020-2021 surges), though specific insights depend on the full `nigeria_confirmed` data.

## Future Improvements
- **Filter Nigeria Data**: Explicitly define `nigeria_confirmed` (e.g., `nigeria_confirmed = confirmed[confirmed['Country/Region'] == 'Nigeria'].iloc[:, 4:].sum()`).
- **Add More Visualizations**: Include line plots for deaths and recoveries, or a heatmap for global trends.
- **Utilize Web Scraping**: Implement `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch updated data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Add calculations for case fatality rate or recovery rate.
