# COVID-19 Nigeria Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes COVID-19 data across Nigerian states, focusing on the number of cases, deaths, tests, and case fatality rates (CFR). The data is scraped from a table on the PMC NCBI website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, processed with pandas, and visualized using seaborn and matplotlib. The analysis includes a correlation heatmap to explore relationships between key metrics.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Extract and analyze COVID-19 statistics for Nigerian states, with a focus on correlations between cases, deaths, tests, and CFR.
- **Data Source**: Table from https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8548039/table/germs-11-03-391-t002/?report=objectonly, accessed via Selenium.
- **Tools**: Python 3.12.7, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, requests, BeautifulSoup, selenium, html5lib.
- **Output**: A DataFrame with state-wise COVID-19 data and a correlation heatmap.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install seaborn matplotlib requests beautifulsoup4 pandas warnings html5lib selenium urllib3 trio trio-websocket certifi typing_extensions websocket-client attrs sortedcontainers idna outcome sniffio wsproto pysocks
  ```
- Ensure Python 3.12.7 or a compatible version is installed.
- Install a web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Selenium) compatible with your browser version and add it to your system PATH.
- Use a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab or VS Code with Jupyter support).

### Environment Setup
- The notebook uses a Chrome web driver. Replace `webdriver.Chrome()` with `webdriver.Firefox()` if using Firefox, and ensure the corresponding driver is installed.
- No local data files are required; data is fetched dynamically from the web.

## Project Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries
- **Task**: Load necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and web scraping.
- **Implementation**:
  - Imported `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
  - Imported `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for initial HTML parsing attempts.
  - Imported `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - Imported `warnings` to suppress FutureWarning messages with `warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)` for cleaner output.
- **Outcome**: Established a foundation for data processing, visualization, and web interaction.

### 2. Installing Additional Libraries
- **Task**: Install `html5lib` for enhanced HTML parsing and `selenium` for dynamic web scraping.
- **Implementation**:
  - Ran `!pip install html5lib` to install the library (confirmed as already installed).
  - Ran `pip install selenium` to install Selenium (confirmed as already installed), along with its dependencies (e.g., `urllib3`, `trio`, `websocket-client`).
- **Outcome**: Ensured all required libraries were available for web scraping and data handling.

### 3. Initial Web Scraping Attempt
- **Task**: Attempt to scrape data from the PMC NCBI article using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Implementation**:
  - Defined the URL `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8548039/` and fetched the page with `requests.get(url)`.
  - Parsed the HTML with `BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")`.
  - Printed the first 3,000 characters of the prettified HTML with `soup.prettify()[:3000]`.
- **Outcome**: Encountered a 403 Forbidden error, indicating that direct scraping of the page was blocked, necessitating a switch to Selenium for dynamic content access.

### 4. Dynamic Web Scraping with Selenium
- **Task**: Extract the COVID-19 data table from the specified PMC NCBI URL using Selenium.
- **Implementation**:
  - Initialized a Chrome web driver with `webdriver.Chrome()`.
  - Navigated to `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8548039/table/germs-11-03-391-t002/?report=objectonly`.
  - Retrieved the page source with `driver.page_source` and parsed it with `BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")`.
  - Located the table with `soup.find("table")`, extracted rows with `find_all("tr")`, and columns with `find_all(["th", "td"])`.
  - Converted the table data into a pandas DataFrame, using the first row as column headers and subsequent rows as data.
  - Closed the driver with `driver.quit()`.
  - Printed the first five rows with `print(df.head())`.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a DataFrame with 37 rows (one per state) and 7 columns: `State`, `No. of cases`, `% of cases`, `No. of deaths`, `% of deaths`, `CFR`, and `No. of tests`.

### 5. Data Exploration and Visualization
- **Task**: Perform a correlation analysis and visualize it as a heatmap.
- **Implementation**:
  - Created a figure with `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))` for an 8x6 inch plot.
  - Generated a heatmap with `sns.heatmap(df[['No. of cases', 'No. of deaths', 'No. of tests', 'CFR']].corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')` to show correlations between selected metrics, with annotations and a `coolwarm` color map.
  - Added a title with `plt.title('Correlation Between Key COVID-19 Metrics')`.
  - Displayed the plot with `plt.show()`.
- **Outcome**: A heatmap illustrating the correlation between the number of cases, deaths, tests, and CFR, providing insights into their relationships (e.g., positive correlation between cases and deaths).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Save the `ncdc.ipynb` notebook in your working directory.

2. **Set Up Web Driver**:
   - Download and install ChromeDriver (or FirefoxDriver) and ensure itâ€™s in your system PATH.

3. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
   - Run all cells sequentially:
     - Cell 1: Imports libraries.
     - Cell 2: Installs `html5lib` (skip if already installed).
     - Cell 3: Attempts initial scraping (will fail with 403 error).
     - Cell 4: Installs `selenium` (skip if already installed) and scrapes the table.
     - Cell 5: Generates the correlation heatmap.

4. **View Outputs**:
   - The scraped DataFrame (`df.head()`) will display state-wise data.
   - The correlation heatmap will appear as a graphical output.

## Results and Insights
- **Data Structure**: The DataFrame contains data for 37 Nigerian states, with columns showing case counts (e.g., 57,581 in Lagos), death counts (e.g., 439 in Lagos), test numbers (e.g., 428,499 in Lagos), and CFR (e.g., 0.76 in Lagos).
- **Correlation Insights**: The heatmap reveals relationships, such as a likely positive correlation between `No. of cases` and `No. of deaths`, and potentially weaker correlations with `No. of tests` or `CFR`.
- **Limitations**: The initial `requests` approach failed due to access restrictions, and Selenium was required.
  
## Future Improvements
- **Additional Visualizations**: Add bar plots for state-wise cases or deaths, or line plots for trends if time-series data is available.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks for web scraping to handle potential driver or network issues.
- **Expanded Analysis**: Calculate total cases, deaths, and tests, or compare CFR across states statistically.
