# COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI) Analysis for Nigeria

This project analyzes the subnational COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI) for Nigerian states using data from a CSV file containing African subnational CVI metrics. The data is processed with pandas, filtered for Nigeria, and visualized with a correlation heatmap using seaborn and matplotlib to explore relationships between population, CVI, and key thematic indices (Epidemiological, Socioeconomic, and Healthcare System).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize the CVI and related vulnerability themes for Nigerian states to identify correlations and insights.
- **Data Source**: `Africa_CCVI_subnational_zenodo.csv`, loaded from a local file with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
- **Tools**: Python 3.12.7, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.
- **Output**: A filtered DataFrame with Nigerian state data and a correlation heatmap.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas warnings
  ```
- Ensure Python 3.12.7 or a compatible version is installed.
- Download the dataset `Africa_CCVI_subnational_zenodo.csv` and place it in the `/Users/user/Downloads/` directory (update the path as needed).
- Use a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab or VS Code with Jupyter support).

### Environment Setup
- No web scraping or external drivers are required; the project relies on a local CSV file.
- Adjust the file path in the `pd.read_csv()` call if the dataset is stored elsewhere.

## Project Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries
- **Task**: Load necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Imported `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
  - Imported `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` (though unused in this version).
  - Imported `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - Imported `warnings` to suppress FutureWarning messages with `warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)` for cleaner output.
- **Outcome**: Established a foundation for data processing and visualization.

### 2. Loading and Previewing Data
- **Task**: Load the CSV file containing CVI data for African subnational regions and preview its structure.
- **Implementation**:
  - Used `pd.read_csv('/Users/user/Downloads/Africa_CCVI_subnational_zenodo.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')` to load the data with ISO-8859-1 encoding to handle special characters.
  - Displayed the first five rows with `cvi_africa.head()` to verify the data structure.
- **Outcome**: Loaded a DataFrame with 21 columns, including `GID_0`, `NAME_0`, `GID_1`, `NAME_1`, `Population`, and various `Th1_within` to `CCVI_across` metrics, with 5 rows shown (e.g., Angola's Bengo, Hu√≠la, etc.).

### 3. Filtering and Renaming Columns
- **Task**: Filter the data for Nigeria and rename columns for clarity.
- **Implementation**:
  - Filtered the DataFrame with `cvi_africa[cvi_africa['NAME_0'] == 'Nigeria'].copy()` to create `cvi_nigeria`.
  - Renamed columns to descriptive names using a list of 21 strings, mapping original columns like `NAME_0` to `Country`, `NAME_1` to `State`, and thematic indices (e.g., `Th1_within` to `Epidemiological_Within`) to their respective categories.
  - Displayed the first five rows of `cvi_nigeria` with `cvi_nigeria.head()` to confirm changes.
- **Outcome**: Created a DataFrame with 37 rows (one per Nigerian state) and 21 columns, starting with states like Abia, Delta, and Ebonyi, with renamed columns reflecting vulnerability themes.

### 4. Data Exploration
- **Task**: Inspect the structure and data types of the filtered DataFrame.
- **Implementation**:
  - Used `cvi_nigeria.info()` to display the DataFrame's summary, showing 37 non-null entries across all 21 columns, with `Population` as `int64` and other metrics as `float64`.
- **Outcome**: Confirmed the dataset contains no missing values, with `Population` ranging from 3192000 (Ebonyi) to higher values, and vulnerability indices (e.g., `CVI_Nigeria`) ranging from 0.027778 to 0.694444.

### 5. Visualization with Heatmap
- **Task**: Generate a correlation heatmap for selected numerical columns.
- **Implementation**:
  - Selected columns `['Population', 'CVI_Nigeria', 'Epidemiological_Within', 'Socioeconomic_Within', 'Healthcare_System_Within']` for correlation analysis.
  - Computed the correlation matrix with `cvi_nigeria[numeric_cols].corr()`.
  - Created a figure with `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))` for an 8x6 inch plot.
  - Generated a heatmap with `sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1)` to display correlations with annotations and a `coolwarm` color map.
  - Added a title with `plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of CVI and Themes')`.
  - Displayed the plot with `plt.show()`.
- **Outcome**: A heatmap illustrating correlations, such as potential relationships between `CVI_Nigeria` and `Socioeconomic_Within`, providing insights into vulnerability factors.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Save the `ncvi.ipynb` notebook in your working directory.

2. **Set Up Dataset**:
   - Download `Africa_CCVI_subnational_zenodo.csv` and place it in `/Users/user/Downloads/` (update the path as needed).

3. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
   - Run all cells sequentially:
     - Cell 1: Imports libraries.
     - Cell 2: Loads and previews the full dataset.
     - Cell 3: Filters for Nigeria and renames columns.
     - Cell 4: Displays data info.
     - Cell 5: Generates the correlation heatmap.

4. **View Outputs**:
   - The initial `cvi_africa.head()` shows Angola data.
   - The `cvi_nigeria.head()` displays Nigerian state data.
   - The correlation heatmap visualizes relationships between selected metrics.

## Results and Insights
- **Data Structure**: The `cvi_nigeria` DataFrame includes 37 states, with `Population` (e.g., 4190000 for Abia), `CVI_Nigeria` (e.g., 0.111111 for Abia), and thematic indices (e.g., `Epidemiological_Within` ranging from 0.083333 to 0.500000).
- **Correlation Insights**: The heatmap reveals relationships, such as a potential positive correlation between `Socioeconomic_Within` and `CVI_Nigeria`, indicating socioeconomic factors may influence vulnerability.
- **Limitations**: The project lacks data cleaning (e.g., no normalization of `Population`) and deeper analysis (e.g., statistical tests).

## Future Improvements
- **Data Cleaning**: Normalize `Population` or convert to per-capita metrics for fair comparison.
- **Additional Visualizations**: Add bar plots for state-wise CVI or scatter plots for specific correlations.
- **Expanded Analysis**: Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) or cluster analysis to group states by vulnerability.
- **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks for file loading to handle missing or corrupted data.
